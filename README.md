## 📌 Overview

**CareCompanion AI** is a web-based health assistant designed to work completely offline. It empowers users — especially those with disabilities, low literacy, or limited internet access — to receive essential health support using voice, text, or touch-based interactions.

## 💡 Inspiration

Access to healthcare is a basic human right, yet millions in underserved regions struggle to access even basic medical advice. I was especially moved by individuals with disabilities or no internet access who are often left behind by modern health tech. This inspired me to build **CareCompanion AI** — a solution that puts inclusion and accessibility at its core.
